# SublimeKodi
ST3 plugin to show translated Kodi labels in mouseover popup, quickly open the Kodi log, log syntax highlighting and much more.

**Note:** Sublime Text 2 is not supported.  Also, SublimeKodi takes advantage of certain features of ST3 that have bugs in earlier ST3 releases or were implemented during betas.  For the best experience, use the latest ST3 dev build.
