  KodiDevKit (former SublimeKodi) - https://github.com/phil65/KodiDevKit
  =================

  KodiDevKit finally made it to packagecontrol. :) This script contains lot of little helper
  functions to assist with skin and script development as well as custom syntax highlighting,
  remote uploading add-ons via ADB, syntax highlighting for Kodi log files and Skin XMLs,
  and much more.

  To get started, have a look at the settings file first.
  In order to use all features, you also need to install the Kodi plugin "Toolbox script"
  (script.toolbox) from the official Kodi repositories.
  That way this script can interact with Kodi via JSON-RPC.

  A quite up-to-date feature list can be found here:
  https://github.com/phil65/kodidevkit/blob/master/README.md

  Some calls are not documented yet, I hope to fix that in the next weeks.

  Happy coding!
